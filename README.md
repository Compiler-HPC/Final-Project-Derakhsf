In order to recreate the graphs and delve into the specifics of methods applied across all three benchmarks, I've included both the C++ and Python code for each benchmark. Furthermore, I've provided three scripts tailored for the Niagara Server, each corresponding to a specific array size. These scripts facilitate the reproduction of experimental results. For each script, I've incorporated the output from Niagara, and to streamline analysis, an Excel file has been included. This file encompasses the table derived from the Niagara result files, along with a Pivot table and Pivot chart essential for generating the graphs. It's noteworthy that all graphs have been generated from the same Pivot table, leveraging various filtrations for distinct visualizations. The Excel file also includes a separate sheet that contains a summary of the main table; I have used this sheet to exploit the speed-up factor. (The evaluation file has been also included)
