In the realm of high-performance computing, the
quest for efficient computational methods remains a critical
challenge. This study addresses the performance potential of
Python, a language traditionally not synonymous with high computational efficiency, in the context of the Polyhedral Benchmark
(Polybench) suite. We explore the application of Numba, a JustIn-Time (JIT) compiler, to optimize Python code through parallelization, vectorization and loop unrolling, and transformation
techniques. Our methodology involves the implementation of
selected Polybench benchmarks in Python, followed by their
optimization using Numba’s features. We systematically measure
and compare the performance of the optimized Python code
against its unoptimized counterparts and Corresponding C++
implementations, focusing on execution time and computational
efficiency. The results indicate significant performance improvements, highlighting the effectiveness of Numba in bridging
the gap between Python’s ease of use and the demands of
high-performance computing. This study not only showcases
the feasibility of Python as a viable option in performancecritical applications but also contributes to the growing body of
knowledge in Python-based scientific computing. Our findings
open avenues for further research in optimizing Python for
high-performance tasks, potentially expanding its adoption in
computational-intensive domains.
